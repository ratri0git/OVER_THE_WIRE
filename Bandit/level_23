Level Goal

A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. 
Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.


Solution

cd /etc/cron.d
cat /etc/cron.d/cronjob_bandit23
cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh
echo I am user bandit23 | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1
cat /tmp/hash_from_previous_command
