Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed. 
For this level it may be useful to create a directory under /tmp in which you can work. Use mkdir with a hard to guess directory name. 
Or better, use the command “mktemp -d”. Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it using mv (read the manpages!)


Solution

xxd -d data.txt

Script : 

#!/bin/bash

cd /tmp/tmp.XMJOEBYRae

filename="data"

echo "Started.."

while true; do
    ftype=$(file -b --mime-type "$filename")

    case "$ftype" in
        text/plain|text/x-ascii)
            echo "Plain ASCII file found: $filename"
            break
            ;;

        application/x-tar)
            tar -xf "$filename"
            rm -f "$filename"
            ;;

        application/gzip)
            mv "$filename" "${filename}.gz"
            gzip -d "${filename}.gz"
            rm -f "${filename}.gz"
            ;;

        application/x-bzip2)
            mv "$filename" "${filename}.bz2"
            bunzip2 "${filename}.bz2"
            rm -f "${filename}.bz2"
            ;;

        application/zip)
            unzip "$filename"
            rm -f "$filename"
            ;;

        *)
            echo "Unsupported or unknown mime type: $ftype"
            break
            ;;
    esac
    filename=$(ls)

done
