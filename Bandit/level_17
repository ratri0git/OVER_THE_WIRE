Level Goal

The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to 
a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000.
First find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. 
Then find out which of those speak SSL/TLS and which donâ€™t. There is only 
one server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.


Solution

nc -z localhost 31000-32000
openssl s_client -connect localhost:Port
echo "Password" | openssl s_client -connect localhost:31790 -quiet
