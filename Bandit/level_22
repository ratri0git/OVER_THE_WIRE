Level Goal

A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. 
Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.


Solution

cd /etc/cron.d
cat cronjob_bandit22
cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh
cat /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv
